# breaker2D
A 2D simulator built to model the interactions between waves and coastline

## Getting started
The code's dependencies can be built in a [Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) environment. To activate and install the environment, run 
```shell
spack env activate -d .
spack install
```
The code can then be built with [FPM](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm): ```fpm build```
